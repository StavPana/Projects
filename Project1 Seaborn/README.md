#Project Description
Dataset:
We used the Hotel Booking Demand dataset from the Kaggle.
https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand

This data set contains booking information for  city hotel and  resort hotel and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things

Questions that we are going to answer are:

Is there any connection between country and cancellation ?
Dependency between accommodation type and month period over year ?
How market segment defines Average Daily Rate ?
Connection between ADR - time for City and Resort hotel respectively ?
